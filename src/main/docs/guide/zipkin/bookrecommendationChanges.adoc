Modify `build.gradle` to add `tracing` dependency.

[source,java]
.bookrecommendation/build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    ...
    ..
    .
include::{sourceDir}/bookrecommendation/build.gradle[tag=tracing]
}
----

Also, to send tracing spans to Zipkin the minimal configuration requires you add the following dependencies to `build.gradle`:

[source,java]
.bookrecommendation/build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    ...
    ..
    .
include::{sourceDir}/bookrecommendation/build.gradle[tag=zipkin]
}
----


Append to `bookrecommendation` service `application.yml` the following snippet:

[source,yaml]
.bookrecommendation/src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/bookrecommendation/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=zipkin]
----

<1> Trace 100% of requests.

In production, you will probably want to trace a smaller percentage of the requests. However, in order to keep this tutorial easy, we set it to trace 100%.

Disable distributed tracing in tests:

[source,yaml]
.bookrecommendation/src/main/resources/application-test.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/bookrecommendation/src/main/resources/application-test.yml[tag=zipkin]
----
